# Builds a toolbox image locally and installs its manifest.
#
# The image is referenced by its **image ID** — the content hash `docker build`
# produces — rather than by a registry digest, because GhostAI has to run on a
# machine with no internet. An image ID is a content address and is exactly as
# unrepointable as a registry digest; a tag is neither, and a toolbox pinned to
# one would let the thing an operator approved change underneath them.
#
# Installing is only half of it. The manifest lands on disk here; nothing will
# *run* it until its hash is approved, which is a separate operator action —
# editing a manifest silently revokes its approval, and that is the point.

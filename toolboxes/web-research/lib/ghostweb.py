"""Fetching and extraction, shared by `fetch` and `search`.

One module rather than two copies because `search --read` and `fetch` want
exactly the same thing — a URL turned into the least text that still contains the
answer — and a research toolbox whose two entry points disagreed about what a
page says would be a bad toolbox.

Three decisions shape everything here:

  * **Markdown, not flattened text.** A model reads structure. Headings tell it
    which section answers the question, fenced code stays copyable, a table stays
    a table, and a link keeps its target so a follow-up fetch is possible. The
    previous implementation joined every text node with newlines, which threw all
    of that away and produced prose that could not be navigated.

  * **Main-content extraction, not tag stripping.** Removing `nav`/`footer`/
    `aside` by name catches the sites that use those elements and nothing else;
    the modern web is `<div class="sidebar">`. `trafilatura` scores the DOM for
    content density instead, which is the difference between 900 tokens of
    documentation and 6,000 tokens of documentation plus navigation.

  * **Every failure says what to do next.** A client-rendered page, a 403 from a
    bot wall, a PDF — each returns a sentence naming the next move rather than
    empty output, because an agent that cannot tell "nothing there" from "wrong
    tool" burns the rest of its turn guessing.
